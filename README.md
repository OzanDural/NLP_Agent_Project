# NLP_Agent_Project
An autonomous ReAct Agent for Aviation Flight Operations using RAG, Groq LLM, and Open-Meteo API
## ✈️ Aviation ReAct Dispatcher Agent

This project transforms a static Language Model into an **Autonomous ReAct Agent** specialized for Aviation Dispatch operations. Powered by **Llama-3.3-70B**, the agent reasons, decides, and solves complex flight planning problems by interacting with technical documents and real-time external APIs.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The primary objective is to assist flight dispatchers in verifying safety limits and calculating operational costs. Unlike a standard LLM, this agent follows the **Thought -> Action -> Observation** cycle to ensure every decision is backed by technical data or live environmental conditions.
